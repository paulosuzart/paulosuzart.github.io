Hi, this is another blog of mine. Yap, I have a - mostly in portuguese - wordpress called [codemountain](http://codemountain.wordpress.com), and a [Posterous](http://posterous.com/paulosuzart) _(unreachable)_. Maybe I move to here and kill the others. Don't know yet.

The main reason to starting blogging directly on my Github is to keep the subjects even more focused on projects committed here, and share some experiences with some libs also committed here. I also keep a weekly updated awesome repo [https://github.com/paulosuzart/awesome](https://github.com/paulosuzart/awesome) with a list of starred projects on github.

I write code since 2004 and worked in a variety of industries and technologies. You can find an up to date CV on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).

**BTW! Since August 2025 I'm freelancing. If you are interested in consulting in defining your microservice architecture, CI/CD strategy, Engineering practices in general, please reach out via GitHub.**
